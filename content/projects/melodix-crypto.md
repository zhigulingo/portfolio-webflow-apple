A rhythm game within Telegram Mini Apps, integrating NFTs and cryptocurrency to revolutionize music monetization. I contributed to the project's pitch by designing engaging demo presentations and creating interactive in-game assets. Additionally, I developed promotional videos, in-game animations, and visuals to enhance the user experience. The project debuted at a hackathon, showcasing its innovative use of blockchain and gamification in the music industry.
