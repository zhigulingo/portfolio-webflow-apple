On this project, I had the opportunity to utilize all the latest generative AI tools in action: Midjourney, Magnific, and several others that assisted throughout the project. From GPT to adjust prompts for MJ to FireFly from Adobe to address halting issues from other AI in the final scenes, we used a wide range of generative AI technologies.

The project focused on desktop marketing teams from the beginning of the agency until now, serving as a retrospective with engaging artifacts that showcase the most hyped topics of the current year, such as events and music.

After generating the animated scenes with depth, I've integrated them into the website with an interactive game-like experience that offers a timeline that can be explored through interactions with artifacts and a slight perspective orientation.
