First telegram contest has passed at summer 2024. I participated in it and was presenting a new look for wallet main page. Task was to create a separate home pages for custodial wallet that work straight within Telegram and non-custodial TON wallets, that can be stacked and have a features to collect more different tokens and NFT.

By the course of this contest I was filming the process and published them on YouTube. You are welcome to join me on my path creating UI for wallet main page.
