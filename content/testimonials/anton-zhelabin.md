content: "Working with Gleb as a junior project manager was an absolute pleasure. They displayed exceptional organizational skills and a natural ability to build rapport with clients and teams. What truly stood out was their initiative — Gleb didn’t just follow the brief; they identified opportunities to improve processes and communication flows, keeping every stakeholder on track. For someone at a junior level, their understanding of creative project dynamics and client relationships is remarkable. I can’t wait to see their growth in the industry."
