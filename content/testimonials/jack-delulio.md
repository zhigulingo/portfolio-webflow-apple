*We entrusted Gleb with the motion design for a mobile app promo video, and they delivered beyond expectations. Gleb understood the product's essence, balancing usability with a visually compelling story. Their work showcased smooth transitions, dynamic pacing, and clear messaging, making the app feel instantly appealing to its audience. What impressed me most was their attention to detail — every animation felt purposeful and polished. They are a designer I'd recommend to any producer looking for exceptional promo visuals.*
